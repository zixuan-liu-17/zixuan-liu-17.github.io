#### Postdoctoral Research

**Research Assistant**(Bristol, 2024): As a joint Research Assistant co-supervised by Dr Bangdong Zhi (Bristol) and Oliver Y. Chen (CHUV and UNIL), I am using generative AI models to extract key information** from textual literature in healthcare operation, health management, and medicine. Additionally, I contributed to summarising the findings in a comprehensive report, which will be published to share our insights with the broader research community. Based on the findings, I **developed a web app** that recommend academic paper to audience based on semantic similarities.

**Thesis**: Imprecision in Social Learning; **Supervisors**: Jonathan Lawry and Michael Crosscombe

- The project investigates the role of imprecision in decentralized social learning/**collective decision-making**, developing a novel parameterized fusion operator for uncertain beliefs to explore the effects of fusion imprecision on learning performance, and a novel evidential updating strategy based on **Maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian Inference**. It has also demonstrated the robustness of social learning models to imprecise evidence and proposed a model with various levels of imprecise evidnece that enhances the efficacy of learning processes in noisy environments. We then proposed an integrated model that significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the collective decision making process.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Developed an **Epistemic Set Theory-based model** that provide a novel approach to differentiate between ***imprecision*** and ***error*** in agent beliefs and noise in  deeply uncertain environment, enhancing the representation of information in collective learning and AI under uncertainty.
  - Introduced a novel parameterised fusion operator based on Jaccard Similarity that **optimises** multi-agent learning outcomes by adjusting the precision level of belief fusion, particularly effective when the evironmental noise is high.
  - Demonstrated the robustness of social learning to imprecise evidence through a **Hamming-distance-based updating model**, identifying that an optimal level of imprecision that balances learning speed and accuracy.
  - Demonstrated the strong potential of the proposed social learning framework for real-world applications in multi-robot systems under noisy conditions and hardware limitations by applying it to **a multi-robot location classification problem,** 
  - Highlighted the limitations of traditional evidential updating methods in high-error scenarios and proposed a new approach that significantly improves learning accuracy at the expense of increased convergence time.
